# Reuse Items Application

This is a Python-based application that allows users to manage a list of reusable items. The application lets users add, delete, search, and display items, along with storing item information such as the name, description, contact type (Phone or WeChat), and contact information (Phone number or WeChat ID).

The application provides a simple GUI using `tkinter`.

## Features

- **Add Item**: Allows users to add a new item with its name, description, contact type (Phone or WeChat), and contact information.
- **Delete Item**: Allows users to delete an item by its ID.
- **Search Item**: Users can search for items by their name. It supports:
  - **Exact Match**: Displays items that exactly match the input name.
  - **Partial Match**: Displays items that contain any character(s) from the input name.
- **Display All Items**: Displays a list of all items stored in the application.
